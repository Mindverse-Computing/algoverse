# 🧠 Agentome: A Multi-Agent AI System with Knowledge Graph Memory for Solving Coding Problems

## Introduction

In the age of AI-assisted reasoning and problem solving, coding interview preparation remains a uniquely challenging domain. It requires not only technical knowledge but also strategic thinking, memory recall, conceptual mapping, and code synthesis. Traditional AI models are good at generating answers—but they often lack consistency, reasoning transparency, and contextual memory.

**Agentome** is a breakthrough architecture that solves this by simulating **human-like cognitive faculties through a multi-agent AI system**, powered by a **knowledge graph-based memory network**. It provides not just answers, but structured reasoning, explainable solutions, and long-term learning through graph-based synchronization.

## What Is Agentome?

**Agentome** is a multi-agent cognitive system inspired by the way the human mind solves problems. Each agent performs a distinct cognitive role:

| Agent      | Role in the System                                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sense**  | Understands the problem context, tags relevant concepts          |
| **Memory** | Searches prior solved problems and code strategies               |
| **Intellect** | Generates multiple candidate strategies                      |
| **Action** | Converts strategies into executable, optimized Python code       |
| **Ego**    | Evaluates and composes the best solution from all agents         |

What sets Agentome apart is its **memory system** — not a simple cache, but a **dynamic knowledge graph** that grows smarter with every solved problem.

## Why Knowledge Graph Memory?

A **Knowledge Graph** provides an ideal structure for representing and navigating relationships between problems, concepts, and strategies.

### 🧩 Example Node Types

| Node Type     | Attributes                                |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Problem`     | Title, description, difficulty, tags      |
| `Strategy`    | Name, type, description                   |
| `Concept`     | Algorithmic or data structure concept     |
| `CodeSnippet` | Python code, complexity, walkthrough      |

### 🔗 Example Relationships

| Relationship        | Description                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `USES_STRATEGY`     | Problem employs a specific strategy           |
| `IMPLEMENTED_BY`    | Strategy leads to code generation             |
| `INVOLVES`          | Strategy depends on algorithmic concept       |
| `SIMILAR_TO`        | Problems that are structurally related        |

This structure allows Agentome to **synchronize** with related problems and solutions from past experience, dynamically adjusting its approach based on prior knowledge.

## How Agentome Works (System Overview)

✅ Files in the `agentome/` folder :

- `base.py` – defines `AgentBase`
- `sense_agent.py` – parses and analyzes the problem
- `memory_agent.py` – connects to and queries/stores in the knowledge graph
- `intellect_agent.py` – generates algorithm strategies
- `action_agent.py` – turns strategies into code
- `ego_agent.py` – selects the best strategy/code
- `knowledge_graph.py` – manages Neo4j ingestion
- `system.py` – orchestrates the entire Agentome workflow



### Step 1: Problem Understanding — `SenseAgent`
- Takes raw problem text as input
- Parses key ideas, example inputs/outputs
- Classifies the problem into categories (e.g., Array, Graph, DP)
- Tags involved concepts (e.g., Sliding Window, Hash Map)

### Step 2: Memory Search — `MemoryAgent`
- Looks up semantically similar problems from the **knowledge graph**
- Retrieves associated strategies and code snippets
- Supplies these as contextual support for the next agent

### Step 3: Strategic Planning — `IntellectAgent`
- Proposes multiple strategies (e.g., Brute Force, Greedy, DP)
- Describes the pros/cons and structure of each
- Maps strategies to reusable concepts from the graph

### Step 4: Code Generation — `ActionAgent`
- Implements each strategy using clean, commented Python code
- Includes complexity analysis and explanation
- Associates each implementation with a node in the graph

### Step 5: Final Evaluation — `EgoAgent`
- Reviews all code implementations
- Selects the best solution based on efficiency and clarity
- Logs the full trace into the knowledge graph

## Synchronization Through Knowledge Graph Traversal

Unlike simple vector databases, the knowledge graph supports **pathway-based synchronization**:

> When a new problem is introduced, the system traverses the graph to **synchronize** with:
> - Previously solved similar problems (`SIMILAR_TO`)
> - Strategies known to work in that context (`USES_STRATEGY`)
> - Underlying concepts relevant to the structure (`INVOLVES`)

This allows **contextual memory activation**: the Agentome doesn’t just “remember” — it **thinks in a structured web of relationships**.
